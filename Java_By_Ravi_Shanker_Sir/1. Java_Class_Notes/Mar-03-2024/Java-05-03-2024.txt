----------
PC Register :
-------------
It stands for Program counter Register.

In order to hold the current executing instruction of running thread we 
separate PC register for each and every thread.

Native Method Stack :
----------------------
Native method means, the java methods which are written by using native languages 
like C and C++. In order to write native method we need native method library support.

Native method stack will hold the native method information in a separate stack.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Execution Engine :
------------------
Interpreter 
------------
In java, JVM is an interpreter which executes the program line by line. JVM (Interpreter)
 is slow in nature because at the time of execution if we make a mistake at line number 9 
then it will throw the execption at line number 9 and after solving the execption again it 
will start the execution from line number 1 so it is slow in execution that is the reason 
to boost up the execution java software people has provided JIT compiler.

JIT Compiler :
--------------
It stands for just in time compiler. The main purpose of JIT compiler to boost up the 
execution so the execution of the program will be completed as soon as possible.

JIT compiler holds the repeated instruction like method signature, variables and make 
it available to JVM at the time of execution so the overall execution becomes very fast.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Exception Handling :
--------------------
What is an execption ?
----------------------
An execption is a runtime error.

An execption is an abnormal situation or un-expected situation in a noraml execution flow.

An exception encounter due to dependency, if one part of the program is dependent to another 
part then there might be a chance of getting Exception.

AN EXCEPTION ALSO ENCOUNTER DUE TO WRONG INPUT GIVEN BY THE USER.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Exception Hierarchy :
--------------------
This Exception hierarchy is available in the diagram (Exception_Hierarchy.png)

Note :- As a developer we are responsibe to handle the Exception. System admin is responsibe 
to handle the error because we cannot recover from error.
