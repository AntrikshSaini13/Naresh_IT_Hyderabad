Program 01
----------
Create a class Person with instance variables name and age. Implement an instance block that prints "Person instance created".

 Implement a parameterized constructor that sets the instance variables name and age. Implement an instance method introduce()

 that prints "Hi, my name is {name} and I'm {age} years old". Create two Person objects and call the introduce() method on them.



Expected Output:

Person instance created

Hi, my name is Naresh and I'm 23 years old

Person instance created

Hi, my name is Suresh and I'm 25 years old

Program 02 :
------------
Create a class Rectangle with instance variables width and height. Implement an instance block that initializes

 the instance variables to 0. Implement a parameterized constructor that sets the instance variables width and height.

 Implement an instance method getArea() that returns the area of the rectangle. Implement another instance method getPerimeter()

 that returns the perimeter of the rectangle. Create a Rectangle object with width 5 and height 10 and call

 the getArea() and getPerimeter() methods on it.



Expected output:

Area of a Rectangle = 50.0

Perimeter of a Rectangle = 30.0

Program 03 :
------------
Create a class BankAccount with instance variables balance and interestRate. Implement an instance block that initializes

 the instance variable interestRate to 0.01. Implement a parameterized constructor that sets the instance variable balance.

 Implement an instance method deposit(amount) that adds amount to the balance. Implement another instance method withdraw(amount)

 that subtracts amount from the balance. Implement an instance method calculateInterest() that returns

 the interest earned on the balance based on the interestRate. Create a BankAccount object with a balance of 1000 and call the

 deposit(), withdraw(), and calculateInterest() methods on it.

Expected output:

Balance amount after deposit of 2500.0 rupees in the bank account is = 3500.0

Balance amount after withdraw of 387.0 rupees from the bank account is = 3113.0

Interest earned on balance amount is = 31.13

Program 04 :
------------
Create a class Car with instance variables make, model, and year. Implement an instance block that initializes the instance variables to empty strings and 0 for year. Implement a parameterized constructor that sets the instance variables make, model,

 and year. Implement an instance method getDescription() that returns a string with the format "{make} {model} ({year})".

 Create a Car object with make "Kia", model "Seltos", and year 2024 and call the getDescription() method on it.

 

Expected output:



  Kia Seltos 2024
