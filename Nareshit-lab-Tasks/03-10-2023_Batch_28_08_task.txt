// Tuesday--------------------------------   represented as  3

// Wednesday --------------------------   represented as  4

// Thursday------------------------------   represented as  5

// Friday ---------------------------------   represented as  6

// Saturday-----------------------------    represented as  7
// Saturday and sunday is known as weekend

// taken the leave

//  -> Trainer 

//  (Indicated by T or t)

//  Home Allowance  =10000

//  Food Allowance  =3000

//  else 5% of total salary



// [note: Take the Designation and salary from the user and based on the that 

//     calculate Total Salary and also based on Total Salary calculate the tax].
