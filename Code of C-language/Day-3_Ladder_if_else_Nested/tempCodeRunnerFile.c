Write a program to read 5 subject marks from user and check whether student is pass, fail or not_pass & not_fail(ATKT-   Allowed).

//     NOTE : marks should be greater than 0 and less than 100 otherwise print "INVALID MARKS".
// 	pass: if student gets more than or equals 35 marks
// 	fail: if student gets less than 35 marks
// 	No_pass & No_fails(ATKT-Allowed to keep terms): if student is failed in 1 or 2 subjects

//     1) If student having more than 35 marks in all subject then print "STUDENT IS PASS".
//     2) If student having more than 35 marks in any 1 OR 2 subject then print STUDENT IS NOT_PASS and NOT_FAIL(ATKT)".
