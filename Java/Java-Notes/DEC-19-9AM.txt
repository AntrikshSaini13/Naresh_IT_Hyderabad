What is a language?
-------------------
A language is a communication media through which we can communicate with
each other.

What is a programming language?
--------------------------------
A Programming language is an intermediate between the user and computer System.

Every language contains two important aspects :
      1) Syntax (Rules given by the language)
      2) Semantics (Meaning OR Structure of the language)

In English language, if we want to make a translation then the syntax is :

Subject + verb + Object
She  is   a   girl. [Valid]
She  is   a   box.  [Invalid but still I am following the syntax]

In our programming language also :

int x = 12;
int y = 0;
int z = x /y;

In Java programming language we have 2 types of Security :

1) At Compilation level : Here our java compiler will verify whether the 
   code is valid or not according to the syntax.

2) At Runtime Level : Here our runtime environment will verify the semantics of the code that means the code is meaningful or not?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Statically(Strongly) typed language :-
---------------------------------------
The languages where data type is compulsory before initialization of a variable are called statically typed language.
In these languages we can hold same kind of value during the execution of the program.

Ex:- C,C++,Core Java, C#

Dynamically(Looesly) typed language :-
-------------------------------------------
The languages where data type is not compulsory and it is optional before initialization of a variable then it is called dynamically typed language.

In these languages we can hold different kind of value during the execution of the program.
Ex:- Visual Basic, Javascript, Python
---------------------------------------------------------------
What is a function :-
-----------------------
A function is a self defined block for any general purpose, calculation or printing some data.

The major benefits with function are :-
-------------------------------------------
1) Modularity :- Dividing the bigger modules into number of smaller modules where each module will perform its independent task.

2) Easy understanding :- Once we divide the bigger task into number of smaller tasks then it is easy to understand the entire code.

3) Reusability :- We can reuse a particular module so many number of times so It enhances the reusability nature.

Note :- In java we always reuse our classes.

4) Easy Debugging :- Debugging means finding the errors, With function It is easy to find out the errors because each module is independent with another module. 

Why we pass parameter to a function :-
--------------------------------------------
We pass parameter to a function for providing more information regrading the function.

Eg:-

userdefined function                  predefined function
public void switchOn(int a)            switchOn(3); // The fan is running in mode 3
{
  //start the fan
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Why member functions are called method in java ?
--------------------------------------------------
variable -> fields
function -> methods

Why functions are called method in java?
----------------------------------------------
In C++ there is a facility to write a function inside the class as well as outside of the class by using :: (Scope resolution Operator), But in java all the functions must be declared inside the class only.

That is the reason member functions are called method in java.

Variable -->  Field
function ---> Method
----------------------------------------------------------------
History of java :
----------------
First Name of Java : OAK (In the year 1991 which is a tree name)

Project Name :- Green Project 

Inventor of Java : - James Gosling and his friends

Official Symbol :- Coffee CUP

Java :- Island (Indonesia)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Why java become so popular in the IT Industry ?
-----------------------------------------------------
The role of compiler :
-------------------------
a) Compiler are used to check the syntax.
b) It also check the compatibility issues(LHS = RHS)
c) It converts the source code into machine code.


Java code :
-------------
a) Java programs must be saved having extension .java

b) java compiler(javac) is used to compile our code.

c) After successful compilation we are getting .class file (bytecode)

d) This .class file we submit to JVM for execution prupose (for executing my java code)

JVM :- It stands for Java Virtual Machine. It is a software in the form of interpreter  written in 'C' language.

Every browser contains JVM, Those browsers are known as JEB (Java Enabled Browsers) browsers.
------------------------------------------------------------------

C and C++ programs are platform dependent programs that means the .exe file created on one machine will not be executed on the another machine if the system configuration is different.

That is the reason C and C++ programs are not suitable for website development.

Where as on the other hand java is a platform independent language. Whenever we write a java program, the extension of java program must be .java. 

Now this .java file we submit to java compiler (javac) for compilation process. After successful compilation the compiler will generate a very special machine code file i.e .class file (also known as bytecode). Now this .class file we submit to JVM for execution purpose.

The role of JVM is to load and execute the .class file. Here JVM plays a major role because It converts the .class file into appropriate machine code instruction (Operating System format) so java becomes platform independent language and it is highly suitable for website development.

Note :- We have different JVM for different Operating System that means JVM is platform dependent technology where as Java is platform Independent technology.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between the bit code and byte code.
----------------------------------------------------------
Bit code is directly understood by Operating System but on the other hand byte code is understood by JVM, JVM is going to convert this byte code into machine understandable format.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments in JAVA :-
------------------------
Comments are used to increase the readability of the program. It is ignored by the compiler.
In java we have 3 types of comments 

1) Single line Comment (//)

2) Multiline Comment (/* ------------------------------- */)

3) Documentation Comment (/** -------------------------- */)

WAP in java to display welcome message :
------------------------------------------------
At initial level we can write a java program with the help class and methods.

Syntax for a class 
--------------------
[Access Modifier]  class [Name of the class]
{
            
}

Example :- 
public class Test
{
}

Syntax for a method :
-------------------------
[Access modifier] [return type] [Name of the method] ()
{


}
Example :-
public  void accept()
{
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note :- 
1) In java whenever we write a program we need at least a main method.

2) In java the execution of the program always starts and ends with main method.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Description of main() method :
-----------------------------------
public :-
--------
public is an access modifier in java. The main method must be declared as public otherwise JVM cannot execute our main method or in other words JVM can't enter inside the main method for execution of the program.

If main method is not declared as public then program will compile but it will not be executed by JVM.

Note :- From java compiler point of view there is no rule to declare our methods as public.
----------------------------------------------------------------
static :-
--------
In java our main method is static so we need not to create an object to call the main method.

If a method is declared as a static then we need not to create an object to call that method. We can directly call the static methods with the help of class name (Object is not required).

If we don't declare the main method as static method then our program will compile but it will not be executed by JVM.
------------------------------------------------------------------
void :-
-------
It is a keyword. It means no return type. Whenever we define any method in java and if we don't want to return any kind of value from that particular method then we should write void before the name of the method.

Eg:

public void input()                              public int accept()
{                                                 {
}                                                    return 15;
						   }

Note :- In the main method if we don't write void or any other kind of return type then it will generate a compilation error.

In java whenever we define a method then compulsory we should define return type of method.(Syntax rule)
----------------------------------------------------------------
main() :-
----------
It is a user-defined method because a user is responsible to define some logic inside the main method.

main() method is very important method because every program execution will start from main() method only, as well as the execution of the program ends with main() method only.

We can write multiple main methods in our class but argument must be different.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Command Line Argument (Introduction only) :-
-------------------------------------------
Whenever we pass an argument/parameter to the main method then it is called Command Line Argument.

The argument inside the main method is String because String is a alpha-numeric collection of character so, It can accept numbers,decimals, characters, combination of number and character.

That is the reason java software people has provided String as a parameter inside the main method.(More Wider scope to accept the value)
--------------------------------------------------------------
System.out.println() :-
-------------------------
It is an output statement in java, By using System.out.println() statement we can print anything on the console.

In System.out.println(), System is a predefined class available in java.lang package, out is a reference variable of PrintStream class available in java.io package and println() is a predfined method available in PrintStream class.

In System.out, .(dot) is a member access operator. It is called as period. It is used to access the member of the class.
--------------------------------------------------------------
WAP in java to add two numbers :
--------------------------------
Addition.java
-------------
public class Addition 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int val1 = 100;
		int val2 = 200;
		int result = val1 + val2;
		System.out.println(result);
	}
}

In this program we are getting the result but it is not 
user-friendly, to provide user-friendly message we should re-write the program

public class AdditionWithMessage 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int val1 = 100;
		int val2 = 200;
		int result = val1 + val2;
		System.out.println("Sum is :" + result);
	}
}
---------------------------------------------------------------
//WAP to add two numbers without 3rd variable

public class AdditionWithout3rdVariable 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int x = 12;
		int y = 15;
		System.out.println("Addition is :"+x+y); //Addition is :1215
		System.out.println(+x+y);//27
		System.out.println("Addition is :"+(x+y));
	}
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------
Command Line Argument :
-----------------------
Whenever we pass any argument to the main method then it is called Command Line Argument.

By using command line argument we can pass some value at runtime.

The advantage of Command Line Argumenet is "Single time Compilation and 
number of times execution".

Note :- String is a collection of alpha-numeric character so Java software people decided to pass String as a parameter hence, it can accept all different types of values like int, float, double, character and so on.

Note :- If we modify .java file then we should re-compile our java file to generate a new .class file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Accepting value from Command Line
public class Command 
{
	public static void main(String[] x) 
	{
		System.out.println(x[0]);
	}
}

javac Command.java
java Command Virat Rohit Siraj

Output :- Virat
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
WAP to take different value at the time of running the program 

//WAP to take different value at the time of running the program 

public class DifferentValuesFromCommand
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		System.out.println(args[0]);
	}
}

javac DifferentValuesFromCommand.java
java DifferentValuesFromCommand Rahul Rohit Dhoni
Output :- Rahul
java DifferentValuesFromCommand Smiriti Mithali Jhulan
Output :- Smiriti
java DifferentValuesFromCommand ABC DEF GHI
Output :- ABC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Eclipse IDE :
-------------
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. By using Eclipse IDE, we can develop, compile and execute our program in a single window. 

The main purpose of Eclipse IDE to reduce the development time, Once developemnt time will be reduced, automatically the cost of the project will be reduced.

WAP in Eclipse IDE to print full name of user through command Line Argument 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
package com.ravi.command;

public class FullNameByCommand 
{
  public static void main(String[] args) 
  {
	System.out.println(args[0]);
	
  }
}

java FullNameByCommand.java (Compilation)
java FullNameByCommand  Virat Kohli
Output :- Virat 
java FullNameByCommand  "Virat Kohli"
Output :- Virat Kohli
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WAP to accept integer value from command line Argument :
--------------------------------------------------------
package com.ravi.command;

public class AcceptIntUsingCommand 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		System.out.println(args[0]);
	}

}

javac AcceptIntUsingCommand.java
java AcceptIntUsingCommand 12 89
Output : 12
java AcceptIntUsingCommand 12.45 89.78
Output : 12.45
java AcceptIntUsingCommand true false
Output : true

From the above it is clear that String parameter in the main method will accept different kinds of values.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WAP to add two numbers using Command line Argumenent :
------------------------------------------------------
package com.ravi.command;

public class CommandAddition 
{
	public static void main(String[] num) 
	{
		System.out.println(num[0] + num[1]);
	}

}

javac CommandAddition.java 
java CommandAddition 123 123
Output : 123123 [Here '+' operator behaves as a String concatenation Operator]

How to convert String into Integer :
------------------------------------
If we want to convert any String value into corresponding integer then java software people has provided predefined class called Integer available in java.lang package. 

In this class we have predefined static method, parseInt(String x) which is accepting a single parameter String as a parameter and convert this String into int value as shown in the below example.

public class Integer
{
  public static int parseInt(String x)
  {
   //Here logic is written to convert x which is String into corresponding int
  }
}

Note :-  "123" ------> parseInt(String x) ---------> 123 [Accepting String and converting into integer]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WAP to add two numbers using command line Argument with the help of Integer class
package com.ravi.command;

public class CommandAddition 
{
	public static void main(String[] num) 
	{	   
		
		  int a = Integer.parseInt(num[0]);
		  int b = Integer.parseInt(num[1]);		  
		  System.out.println("Sum is :"+(a+b));
	}

}

javac CommandAddition.java 
java CommandAddition 123 123
Output 246
java CommandAddition 500 1000
Output 1500

What is a Package ?
-------------------
A package is nothing but folder in windows or directory in DOS.
A package is of two types :

1) Predefined Package :- Created by java software people. 
   Example :- java.lang, java.util, java.io, java.text, java.awt and so on

2) Userdefined Package :- Created by user.
   Example :- com.ravi.basic, com.ravi.introduction, com.ravi.oop and so on

   The program which contains package statement is different style of
   compiling :

   javac -d . Test.java
   (javac space -d space . space FileName.java)

   Program :
   ---------
   package com.tcs.shopping;

   public class Ravi 
   {
	
   }

   javac -d . Ravi.java
   3 folders will be created and then the .class file will be placed 
   inside the folder.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program which describes how Integer.parseInt(String str) is working :
---------------------------------------------------------------------
File Name :
Main.java
---------
package com.ravi.basic;

public class Main 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int result =  Calculate.doSum(12, 36);
		System.out.println("Addition of two number :"+result);
		
		result =  Calculate.getSquare(12);
		System.out.println("Square is :"+result);
		
		result =  Calculate.getCube(2);
		System.out.println("Cube is :"+result);
	}
}

class Calculate
{
	public static int doSum(int x, int y)
	{
		int z = x + y;
		return z;
	}
	
	public static int getSquare(int a)
	{
		int b = a * a;
		return b;
	}
	
	public static int getCube(int p)
	{
		return (p*p*p);
	}
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Naming convention in Java :
----------------------------
 1) How to write a class in java 
----------------------------------
While writing a class in java we should follow pascal naming convention. A java class represents noun.

ThisIsExampleOfClass (Each word first letter is capital)
Example :
-----------
String 
System
Integer
BufferedReader
DataInputStream
ClassNotFoundException
ArithmeticException

2) How to write a method in java :
---------------------------------------
In order to write methods in java we need to follow camel case naming convention. A java method represents verb.

thisIsExampleOfMethod()

Example:
----------
read()
readLine()
toUpperCase()
charAt()


3) How to write variable(Fields) in java 
--------------------------------------------
In order to write variables in java we need to follow camel case naming convention.

rollNumber;
employeeName;
customerNumber;
customerBill;

4) How to write final variable(Field)
-------------------------------
final double PI = 3.14;
final int A = 90;

5) How to write final and static variable 

   MAX_VALUE;
   MIN_VALUE;
Each character must be capital and in between every word _ symbol should be there.

6) How to write package 

   Package name must be in small character. It is reverse of company name.
   com.ravi.basic;            
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Token :
--------
A token is the smallest unit of the program that is identified by the compiler.

Every Java statements and expressions are created using tokens.

A token can be divided into 5 types 

1) Keywords
2) Identifiers
3) Literals
4) Punctuators
5) Operators

Keyword :- 
----------
A keyword is a predefined word whose meaning is already defined by the compiler.

In java all the keywords must be in lowercase only.

A keyword we can't use as a name of the variable, name of the class or name of the method.

true, false and null look like keywords but actually they are literals.


Identifiers :
--------------
A name in java program  by default considered as identifiers.

Assigned to variable, method, classes to uniquely identify them.

We can't use keyword as an identifier.

Ex:-

class Fan 
{
   int coil  ;
   
   void start()
   {
   }
}

Here Fan(Name of the class), coil (Name of the variable) and start(Name of the function) are identifiers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules for defining an identifier :
------------------------------------
1) Can consist of uppercase(A-Z), lowercase(a-z),  digits(0-9), $ sign, and   underscore (_)
2) Begins with letter, $, and _
3) It is case sensitive
4) Cannot be a keyword
5) No limitation of length 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Literals :-
-----------
Assigning some constant value to variable is called Literal.

Java supports 5 types of Literals :

1) Integral Literal  Ex:-  int x = 15;

2) Floating Point Literal  Ex:- float x = 3.5f;

3) Character Literal Ex:- char ch = 'A';

4) Boolean Literal Ex:- boolean b = true;

5) String Literal Ex:- String x = "Naresh i Technology";

Note :- null is also a literal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Integral Literal :
------------------
If any numberic literal does not contain decimal or fraction then it is called Integeral Literal.
Example :-  67, 89, 234,  

In Integeral literal we have 4 data types 
byte (8 bits)
short (16 bits)
int (32 bits)
long (64 bits)


Integral literal we can represent into four different forms :
  a) Decimal Literal (0-9)
  b) Octal Literal (0-7)
  c) Hexadecimal Literal (0-9 and A-F)
  d) Binary Literal (0 and 1) [Came from java 7 onwards]
