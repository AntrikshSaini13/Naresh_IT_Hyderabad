Write a program to read 5 subject marks from user and check whether student is pass, fail or not_pass & not_fail(ATKT-   Allowed).

    NOTE : marks should be greater than 0 and less than 100 otherwise print "INVALID MARKS".
	pass: if student gets more than or equals 35 marks
	fail: if student gets less than 35 marks
	No_pass & No_fails(ATKT-Allowed to keep terms): if student is failed in 1 or 2 subjects
  

    1) If student having more than 35 marks in all subject then print "STUDENT IS PASS".
    2) If student having more than 35 marks in any 1 OR 2 subject then print STUDENT IS NOT_PASS and NOT_FAIL(ATKT)".
    3) else print "STUDENT IS FAIL".
