// Write a C program to print all the automorphic number from 1 to 500.

// An automorphic number is a number whose square ends in the same digits as the number itself.

// For example:

// 5 is an automorphic number because 5 * 5 = 25 (last digit is 5).
// 6 is an automorphic number because 6 * 6 = 36 (last digit is 6).
// 25 is an automorphic number because 25 * 25 = 625 (last digits are 25).
// Write a C program that allows the user to enter a number. The program should calculate the square of the entered number and check if it is an automorphic number or not.

// Your program should:

// Prompt the user to enter a number.
// Calculate the square of the entered number.
// Check if the square ends with the same digits as the original number.
// Display whether the entered number is an automorphic number or not, along with the calculated square.


// Input as : 

// Enter n value : 500

// Expected output :

// 1 5  6  25  76  376
