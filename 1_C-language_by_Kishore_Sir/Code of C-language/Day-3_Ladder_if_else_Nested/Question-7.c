// You are developing a ticket pricing system for a theme park. Write a program that takes the following inputs from a customer:
// Age (integer)
// Height in centimeters (float)
// Whether the customer has a VIP pass (y or n)
// The program should calculate the ticket price based on the following rules:
// Children under 3 years old (inclusive) get in for free.
// Children aged 4 to 12 (inclusive) pay Rs.20.
// Adults aged 13 to 64 (inclusive) pay Rs.100.
// Seniors aged 65 and above pay Rs.50.
// However, there are some additional considerations based on height:
// If the customer is above 180 cm in height, they pay an extra 50.
// If the customer is between 120 cm (inclusive) and 180 cm (inclusive), no additional charge applies.
// If the customer is below 120 cm, they receive a 50% discount on the base ticket price.
// If the customer has a VIP pass, they get a 10% discount on the final ticket price.
// Write a program that implements these pricing rules and provides the following output:
// The customer's age, height, and VIP pass status.
// The calculated base ticket price before any discounts or additional charges.
// Any discounts or additional charges applied based on height.
// The final ticket price after applying all discounts and charges.
// Additionally, if the customer's age is below 0 or height is negative, the program should provide an error message.
