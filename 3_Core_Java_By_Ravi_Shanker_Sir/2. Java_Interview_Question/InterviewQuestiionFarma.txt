Ques - What is Backup and types of Backup ?

Backup refers to the process of creating copies of data to protect it from loss due to 
hardware failure, data corruption, accidental deletion, or disasters. Backups are crucial 
for data recovery and ensuring business continuity.

Types of Backups:

Full Backup:
------------
A complete copy of all data at a specific point in time. It requires the most storage 
space and time to complete but simplifies restoration since all data is in one place.

Incremental Backup:
-------------------
Only backs up data that has changed since the last backup (whether it was a full or 
incremental backup). This method saves storage space and time but requires the last full 
backup and all subsequent incremental backups for complete restoration.

Differential Backup:
--------------------
Backs up all changes made since the last full backup. This takes more storage and time 
than incremental backups but simplifies restoration since only the last full backup and 
the last differential backup are needed.

Mirror Backup:
--------------
A direct copy of the source data, mirroring it in real-time or at scheduled intervals. 
This approach provides quick access but doesn't retain older versions.

Cloud Backup:
-------------
Data is backed up to a cloud service. It offers off-site storage, flexibility, and ease 
of access but relies on internet connectivity and service availability.

Local Backup:
-------------
Data is stored on local devices, such as external hard drives or network-attached storage 
(NAS). It's faster for restoration but vulnerable to physical disasters.

Snapshot Backup:
----------------
Captures the state of a system at a specific moment, often used in virtual environments. 
Snapshots can be quick to create and restore but may consume significant resources over 
time.

Ques - What is LAN and WAN ?

LAN (Local Area Network)
------------------------
Definition: A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices within a 
limited geographic area, such as a home, office, or campus.

Key Features:

Geographic Scope: Covers a small area (typically up to a few kilometers).
Speed: High data transfer rates (100 Mbps to several Gbps).
Ownership: Usually owned and managed by a single organization or individual.
Technology: Commonly uses Ethernet or Wi-Fi for connectivity.
Applications: Ideal for local file sharing, printing, and gaming.

WAN (Wide Area Network)
-----------------------
Definition: A WAN is a network that connects multiple LANs over larger geographic 
areas, potentially spanning cities, countries, or continents.

Key Features:

Geographic Scope: Covers large areas, ranging from hundreds to thousands of kilometers.
Speed: Lower data transfer rates compared to LANs (often a few Mbps to Gbps).
Ownership: Typically involves multiple organizations, may be public (like the internet) 
or private (like a corporate network).
Technology: Utilizes technologies like leased lines, satellites, and fiber optics.
Applications: Supports wide-scale communications, connecting branch offices and providing 
internet access.


Summary
In summary, LANs provide high-speed, localized connectivity, while WANs facilitate 
broader connectivity across larger distances, often requiring more complex infrastructure 
and management.


Ques - What is RAID and Type of RAID?

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
Definition: RAID is a technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into a 
single logical unit to improve data redundancy, performance, or both. It is commonly 
used in servers and storage systems to ensure data integrity and availability.
Types of RAID

RAID 0 (Striping):

Description: Data is split across multiple disks, enhancing performance but offering
 no redundancy.
Pros: Increased read/write speeds.
Cons: If one disk fails, all data is lost.

RAID 1 (Mirroring):

Description: Data is duplicated on two or more disks, providing high redundancy.
Pros: If one disk fails, data remains accessible from the other disk(s).
Cons: Storage capacity is halved, as all data is mirrored.

RAID 5 (Striping with Parity):

Description: Data and parity information are distributed across three or more disks. 
It can tolerate the failure of one disk.
Pros: Balances performance, redundancy, and storage efficiency.
Cons: Slower write speeds due to parity calculations.

RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity):

Description: Similar to RAID 5 but can tolerate the failure of two disks.
Pros: Higher redundancy than RAID 5.
Cons: Additional overhead for parity calculations, leading to slower write speeds.
RAID 10 (1+0):

Description: Combines RAID 1 and RAID 0, providing both striping and mirroring. Data is 
mirrored across pairs of disks and then striped.
Pros: Excellent performance and redundancy.
Cons: Requires at least four disks and has higher storage overhead.

RAID 50 and RAID 60:

Description: These are nested RAID configurations that combine RAID 5 or RAID 6 with 

RAID 0 for improved performance and redundancy.
Pros: Offers the benefits of both RAID types.
Cons: More complex and requires a larger number of disks.
