for each loop :
---------------
It is an enhanced for loop which is used to retrieve the values through the collection data.

It was introduced from java 1.5v.

It is used to fetch the values from collection data one by one so it is known as for each loop.

Program on for-each loop :
--------------------------
package com.ravi.for_each_loop;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class ForEachDemo 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int []values = {89,67,45,23,15};
		
		Arrays.sort(values);		
		
		for(int value : values)
		{
			System.out.println(value);
		}
		
		String []fruits = {"Mango","Orange","Apple"};
		
		Arrays.sort(fruits);
		
		for(String fruit : fruits)
		{
			System.out.println(fruit);
		}
		
	}

}

Note :- Arrays is a predefined class available in java.util package which contains a 
predefined static method sort() through which we can sort the data in ascending order.

Object Orineted Programming (OOPs) :
------------------------------------
What is an Object?
------------------
An object is a physical entity which exist in the real world.
Example :- Pen, Car, Laptop, Mouse, Fan and so on

An Object is having 3 characteristics :

   a) Identification of the Object (Name of the Object)
   b) State of the Object (Data OR Properties OR Variable of Object)
   c) Behavior of the Object (Functionality of the Object)

OOP is a technique through which we can design or develop the programs using class and object.

Writing programs on real life objects is known as Object Oriented Programming.

Here in OOP we concentrate on objects rather than function/method.

Advantages of OOP :
--------------------
1) Modularity  (Dividing the bigger task into smaller task)
2) Reusability (We can reuse the component so many times)
3) Flexibility (Easy to maintain)

Features of OOP :
-----------------
1) Class
2) Object
3) Abstraction
4) Encapsulation
5) Inheritance
6) Polymorphism


What is a class?
-----------------
A class is model/blueprint/template/prototype for creating the object.

A class is a logical entity which does not take any space.

A class is a user-defined data type which contains data member and member function.

public class Employee
{
    Employee Data (Properties) 
         +
    Employee behavior (Function/Method)
}

A CLASS IS A COMPONENT WHICH IS USED TO DEFINE OBJECT PROPERTIES AND 
OBJECT BEHAVIOR.

Student.java
-------------
package com.ravi.oop;

public class Student 
{
	String name;  //Object Properties
	String roll;  //Object Properties
	
	//Object behavior
	public void talk()
	{
		System.out.println("Hi My name is "+name+" and my roll is "+roll);
	}
	
	public void writeExam()
	{
	 System.out.println("I am "+name+ " I am writing exam on every thursday");	
	}
   
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Student raj = new Student();  //object creation    
      //Initializing the Object properties
      raj.name = "Raj Gourav";
      raj.roll = "NIT230001";
      //calling the behavior
      raj.talk();  raj.writeExam();
      
      System.out.println("...........");
      
      Student priya = new Student();
    //Initializing the Object properties
      priya.name = "Priya Kumari";
      priya.roll = "NIT230002";
      //calling the behavior
      priya.talk();  priya.writeExam();
   }
}
